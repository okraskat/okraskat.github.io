In May I ended up in an unusual situation.
A new customer canceled a contract before it actually started.
I was left with no project. At first, it was disappointing. I was angry about the situation, but it's no good crying over spilt milk :)

I began to look for new opportunities. Interviews and calls with potential employers kept me busy for over a month. Here, I want to share with you my thoughts on how does Java Developer hiring process look like in Poland.

Firstly I want to describe what I dislike in recruitment. The worst interview call I had with one of bigger outsourcing companies. It took more than hour, interviewer had a long list of theoretical questions about Java and working in Scrum methodology. After exhausting answering these questions I had chance to ask him about company and about project where I would work. He couldn't answer any of my question. All answers where like "It's depends on project, team" and he barely knows where I would work in their company. So the first thought is:

DO NOT TRY TO PROOF CANDIDATE HIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IF YOU CAN NOT ANSWER ANY OF CANDIDATE QUESTION

Second interview which I didn't enjoy was in smaller software company. We had discussed typical Java interview questions, but after this part I had to write code on whiteboard and then I got second coding task on interviewer computer, where he had different shortcuts in Intellij than defaults ones. He looked over my shoulder how I write code on his computer. It was really stressful. Hopefully I did that task correctly but the second thought is:

DO NOT FORCE CANDIDATE TO LIVE CODING DURING INTERVIEW ON COMPUTER HE NEVER HAD CHANCE TO WORK ON

Let's go to the things which I liked in some interviews. Some companies have recruitment tasks to solve them at home. I think that is fair and square. Company wants to see how candidate solves this task, but candidate can work on computer he knows, he has time to think about project. He can make some research about open source tools which can help him. Recently I wrote 3 interview programs, but only one company checked my code in details, they even measured test code coverage! They also had some questions, about decisions which I made in project. I think that this type of discussion can be inspirational for both sides. So the third thought is:

ASK ABOUT SOLVING CODING TASKS AT HOME, NOT DURING INTERVIEW

Another practice which I never met but I liked from the first time, is to show candidate his future office, his desk and tools. It's also great opportunity to meet future teammates. The fourth thought is:

SHOW CANDIDATE HIS FUTURE OFFICE AND LET HIM TALK TO THE TEAM

Those are my thoughts about recruitment from candidate perspective.
Maybe some interviewers will change their methods and some candidates will feel more comfortable during interviews.

Hope you enjoy this post. If you have any questions or problems leave a comment or send email.
